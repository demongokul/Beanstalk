# Beanstalk 7.1.x.

Soure taken from https://github.com/scotthartbti.

I have no words to thank MZO, Mindfreeze and Bilal who helped me alot to build this ROM.

Also have to thank Scotthartbti for making Beanstalk.

Beanstalk 7.1.x is based of Lineage 14.1

It has lots of customizations.

It comes with OMS7 support and inbuilt Magisk for root.
